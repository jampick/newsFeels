# newsFeels
This is the source for NewsFeels.com and some helper apps.  NewsFeels groups news of the day and groups
it by sentiment of the article letting you read the news based on the news you want to feel.  Want to only read the bummer stories just look at the low sentiment group.  Likewise, for positive stories.

My professional software development days are well behind me so you will likely see many defects and very poor coding form. 
If you would like to help, make recommendations, or just point out some bugs I'd appreciate it.   

## ConsoleApplication1
This console app gathers news stories, detects sentiment, and saves results to database.  I could have been more
creative with the project name.

## newsFeelsWebnews

This is source for NewsFeels.com.  It groups news into low, medium, and high sentiment catagories.
